## Why This Project looks like it does

### Sorry for the mess and the abscence of anything useful

    I was going to finish up some last touches on the project this morning before submission, when i noticed it didnt work and a lot of my files were missing.
    In retrospect this was probably due to me using my girlfriends laptop for the last week leading up to the hackathon and not saving the work/workspace properly, that's my bad.
    This is my third or fourth time "rebuilding" the project today, i kept getting so many error messages and they didnt seem solvable even when i deleted most of my work and kept the "skeleton" that basically was the django blog walkthrough and some minor alterations like a twitter and news api.
    I would probably have noticed earlier if not for being sick these last few days, and i probably shouldve logged on earlier to check but i've never lost work like this so i honestly thought i was looking at the wrong repo at first.
    Anyway, im turning in as is even if it's absolutely useless right now, i was going to ask for extension but i spent the whole morning trying to sort the mess and restarting because i probably added things in the wrong order.
